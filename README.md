# Nvidia DeepStream

1. single-inference: does single primary inferencing on the stream to detect the vehicle, people and signs
2. multiple-inference: does primary inference, on top of that also tracks the objects and assigns each of the object a count, also does car make, car type inferencing
5. rabbitmq-broker: learnt how to stream the messages generated by the deepstream app to a message broker like RabbitMQ

- configs: various config files to be used with `deepstream-app`

NOTE: make sure to do `xhost +` to allow the container to use the host display
